# PLODE
Precise Logic and Delay (PLODE) is a tool that converts a Structural Verilog to a Spice deck, executes Spice simulations using ngspice and performs analysis of the Spice results to extract output delays and logic values. It can handle hierarchical Verilog with nested module instantiations. It takes into consideration glitches at the outputs in computing the output logic values and delays.</br>

To download and run the program correctly:</br>
1. Download ngspice from its website and do its installation.</br>
2. Download QT Creator with QT5 and QTCharts support.</br>
3. Once all downloaded, it can be opened on QT Creator by opening the .pro file with QT Creator.</br>
